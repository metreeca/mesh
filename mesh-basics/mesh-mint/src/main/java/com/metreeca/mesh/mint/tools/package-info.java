/**
 * Code generation and introspection tools for frame interfaces.
 *
 * <p>This package provides the core infrastructure for analyzing annotated Java interfaces
 * and generating corresponding data binding implementations. The tools support both
 * compile-time code generation and runtime introspection capabilities.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Core Components</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>Introspector</strong> - Analyzes frame interface annotations and produces
 *         abstract syntax tree representations for code generation</li>
 *     <li><strong>Generator</strong> - Transforms AST models into executable Java code that
 *         implements frame interface contracts with full semantic web support</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The code generation process transforms declarative frame interfaces into efficient
 * runtime implementations that handle JSON-LD serialization, SHACL validation, and
 * semantic data binding automatically.</p>
