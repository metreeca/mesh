/**
 * Frame code generation and annotation processing infrastructure.
 *
 * <p>This package provides the core annotation processor and supporting infrastructure
 * for generating runtime implementations of frame interfaces. The processor analyzes
 * annotated interfaces at compile time and generates corresponding Java classes that
 * handle JSON-LD serialization, SHACL validation, and semantic data binding.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Core Components</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>FrameProcessor</strong> - Annotation processor that handles compile-time
 *         code generation for frame interfaces</li>
 *     <li><strong>FrameException</strong> - Exception type for frame processing errors</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The annotation processor integrates with the Java compiler toolchain to automatically
 * generate efficient implementations of frame interfaces, eliminating the need for runtime
 * reflection while maintaining full semantic web compatibility.</p>
