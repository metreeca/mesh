/**
 * Sample data models for testing and demonstration purposes.
 *
 * <p>Provides a realistic domain model representing an organization with offices,
 * employees, and career events. The model demonstrates comprehensive usage of
 * Metreeca/Mesh frame annotations including relationships, constraints, and
 * data modeling patterns.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Domain Model</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>{@linkplain com.metreeca.mesh.toys.Resource}</strong> - Base interface for all domain entities
 *         with identity, type, and labeling capabilities</li>
 *     <li><strong>{@linkplain com.metreeca.mesh.toys.Office}</strong> - Organizational locations with geographical
 *         information and employee associations</li>
 *     <li><strong>{@linkplain com.metreeca.mesh.toys.Employee}</strong> - Personnel records with personal details,
 *         organizational relationships, and career tracking</li>
 *     <li><strong>{@linkplain Event}</strong> - Career milestones and organizational changes
 *         embedded within employee records</li>
 *     <li><strong>{@linkplain Catalog}</strong> - Generic collection interface for
 *         organizing domain entities</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Test Data</h2>
 *
 * <p>The {@linkplain Resources} interface provides access to realistic test datasets
 * including 7 offices and 23 employees with complete relationships, constraints,
 * and multilingual content. Data is loaded from TSV files and automatically
 * converted to frame instances.</p>
