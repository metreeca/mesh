/**
 * Marks an interface as a JSON-LD frame.
 *
 * <p>Designates a Java interface as a frame model for JSON-LD serialization and deserialization.
 * Interfaces annotated with {@code @Frame} define the structure of JSON-LD documents and serve as data binding
 * contracts for the Mesh framework.</p>
 *
 * <p>Frame interfaces must adhere to the following requirements:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Must be top-level interfaces (not nested within other types)</li>
 *   <li>Must not be generic interfaces (no type parameters)</li>
 *   <li>Methods must not have arguments</li>
 *   <li>Methods must have non-void return types</li>
 *   <li>Static methods are ignored</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Frame interfaces represent resources in a linked data context, where methods correspond to
 * properties of the resource.</p>
