/**
 * Specifies the RDF predicate for a JSON-LD frame property.
 *
 * <p>Maps a frame method to an RDF predicate using CURIE syntax. This annotation determines how
 * the property is serialized in JSON-LD, defining the semantic relationship between the subject
 * (the frame resource) and the property value.</p>
 *
 * <p>When applied to a method in a {@link Frame} interface, it specifies the RDF predicate to use
 * for the property during JSON-LD serialization and deserialization. If the value is omitted,
 * the method name is used as the predicate name, which is resolved against the default namespace.</p>
