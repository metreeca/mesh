/**
 * Specifies a reverse RDF relationship for a JSON-LD frame property.
 *
 * <p>Maps a frame method to a reverse RDF relationship using CURIE syntax. Unlike {@link Forward},
 * which defines outgoing links from the resource, this annotation represents incoming links to the
 * resource from other resources. This corresponds to the {@code @reverse} keyword in JSON-LD.</p>
 *
 * <p>When applied to a method in a {@link Frame} interface, it specifies that the property value(s)
 * represent resources that link to this resource using the specified predicate. If the value is omitted,
 * the method name is used as the predicate name, which is resolved against the default namespace.</p>
 * 
 * @see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-curie-20101216/">CURIE Syntax 1.0</a>
