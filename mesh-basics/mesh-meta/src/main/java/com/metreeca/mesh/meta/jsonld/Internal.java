/**
 * Marks a method as an internal utility in a JSON-LD frame.
 *
 * <p>Designates a method in a {@link Frame} interface that should be ignored for JSON-LD
 * serialization and deserialization purposes. This annotation allows frames to contain utility methods that are used
 * internally by the application but have no corresponding RDF property.</p>
 *
 * <p>Methods annotated with {@code @Internal} are completely excluded from the frame processing
 * pipeline. They are not considered during serialization or deserialization, and no validation constraints are applied
 * to them. Typically, such methods have default implementations and may accept parameters.</p>
