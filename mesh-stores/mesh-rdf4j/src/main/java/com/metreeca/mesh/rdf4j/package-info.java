/**
 * RDF4J-based graph store implementation for semantic data storage.
 *
 * <p>Provides a comprehensive {@linkplain com.metreeca.mesh.tools.Store Store} implementation
 * built on Eclipse RDF4J infrastructure, enabling persistent storage and querying of 
 * semantic graph data with full SPARQL 1.1 support.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Core Components</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *     <li><strong>{@linkplain com.metreeca.mesh.rdf4j.RDF4JStore}</strong> - Main store implementation providing
