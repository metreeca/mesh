title: "Linked Data Modelling"
---

> **⚠️**  WIP

---

Metreeca/Link services are driven by declarative linked data models defined using a [shape](#shapes)-based specification
language.

Models are [programmatically](../tutorials/publishing-jsonld-apis.md) built using a Java‑based DSL and can
eventually
automate a range of different tasks in the lifecycle of linked data REST APIs.

| task              | shape role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| data selection    | JSON-LD data retrieved from [readable](../tutorials/consuming-jsonld-apis.md#read-operations) linked data REST APIs is selected from the underlying storage layer by  queries derived from the associated linked data models                                           |
| data validation   | JSON-LD data submitted to [writable](../tutorials/consuming-jsonld-apis.md#write-operations) linked data REST APIs on resource creation and updating is automatically validated against the associated linked data models                                              |
| faceted search    | [faceted search](../tutorials/consuming-jsonld-apis.md#faceted-search) and ancillary facet-populating queries are managed by the system on the basis of structural and typing constraints specified in linked data models associated with target linked data REST APIs |
| API documentation | Human and machine readable docs for linked data REST APIs may be dynamically derived from associated linked data models and published as hypertexts and [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org)/[Swagger](https://swagger.io/specification/) specs                         |
| data ingestion    | Data ingested from external data sources may be dynamically mapped to and validated against the linked data models associated with target graphs                                                                                                                       |

> **⚠️**  Some of the described features aren't (yet ;-) directly supported by the framework.

# Shapes

Linked data [shapes](../javadocs/com/metreeca/json/Shape.html) define the expected structure of RDF resource
descriptions
in terms of **constraints** imposed on members of a **focus set** of JSON-LD values and on the values of their
properties.

**Primitive** shapes specify declarative constraints to be meet by the focus set and its member values. **Composite**
shapes recursively assemble other shapes into tree-structured complex constraints.

Linked data selection tasks identify the set of nodes in a graph whose descriptions are consistent with a possibly
composite shape. Selection results are reported either as a graph or a structured report according to the
chosen [query](_faceted-search.md#queries) type.

Linked data validation tasks verify that the description of an initial focus set is consistent with the constraints
specified by a possibly composite shape. During the process, derived focus sets connected
by [structural constraints](#structural-constraints) may be recursively validated. Validation results are reported as a
structured [focus validation trace](../javadocs/com/metreeca/json/Trace.html).

## Value Constraints

Primitive shapes specifying constraints to be individually satisfied by each value in the focus set.

# Parameters

The combined use of conditional (`when`) and parametric (`guard`)  constraints supports the definition of **parametric**
shapes, which specify different sets of constraints according to the current externally-assigned value of parametric **
axis** variables.

Parametric axes may be specified for arbitrary custom variables, but the system relies on four pre‑defined parametric
variables to support fine‑grained access control rules and role‑dependent read/write resource views.

Common combinations of parametric shapes on these axes are directly available as shorthand shapes.

Guards may be applied to groups of shapes either explicitely assembly a `when` shape, like:

```
when(<guard>, and(<shape>, …))
```

or using the shorthand [then](../javadocs/com/metreeca/json/Shape.html#then-com.metreeca.link.Shape...-) method, like:

```
<guard>.then(<shape>, …)
```

## Role Axis

Parametric guards for the [role](../javadocs/com/metreeca/json/shapes/Guard.html#role-java.lang.Object...-) axis
selectively enable target shapes according to the roles of the (possibly authenticated) user performing HTTP/S
operations
on target linked data resources.
